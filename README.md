# Juniors-Zoo-Builder

**Version 1.0.0**

---

## Project Overview

**Juniors-Zoo-Builder** is a game in development designed to engage users in zoo-building and management activities. This initial release sets up the foundational framework with early-stage functionalities, establishing version 1.0.0 as the starting point for future iterations.

## Version 1.0.0 Details

### Core Features

This initial version includes the following basic functionalities:

1. **Guide Bubble and Keyboard Icon Display**  
   - Typing does not yet trigger any building or interaction functions. Instead:
     - The guide bubble disappears.
     - A keyboard icon and a press button are displayed.

2. **Game Saves**  
   - This version does not support game save capabilities. Game progress will reset upon exit.

3. **User Profiles**  
   - User profile creation and management features are not yet implemented.

### Known Limitations

- **Typing Interaction**: Currently, typing only removes the guide bubble without engaging building functions.
- **Lack of Game Persistence**: Game saves are not available, so all progress will be lost after each session.
- **Absence of User Profiles**: No system for managing or storing user data exists in this version.

## Versioning Strategy

With each version update, this project will track the following types of changes:

1. **Line-by-Line Code Documentation**
   - Each update will document specific lines of code that were altered, appended, or removed.
   
2. **Functionality Associations**
   - Changes will be grouped by functional purpose, detailing what aspects of the game they impact (e.g., UI updates, backend logic, game mechanics).
   
3. **Semantic Versioning**
   - This project will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to denote major, minor, and patch-level changes:
     - **Major**: Significant changes that introduce new gameplay mechanics or overhaul core systems.
     - **Minor**: Additions to existing features or improvements that enhance the user experience.
     - **Patch**: Bug fixes, performance improvements, and minor tweaks.
